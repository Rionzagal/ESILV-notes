# Human-Machine Interaction
Human-Machine interaction is referred to all the actions a human can do with a machine. For instance, the posibility to move freely through the air, like in [this video][Jetman Vince Video] or [this other video][Hello Jetman video] is an example of a **Human-Machine interaction**.
## What is HMI?
Human-Machine Interactions are all of the action allowing comminication between an interactive application provided by a machine. 
Human-Machine Interface is referred to all hardware used to provide Human-Machine Interaction.

## HMI approaches
The Human-Machine Interactions are approached by two forms. **Techno-centric approach** and **Antropo-centric approach**. Each of the approaches describe how the technology will be developed and how the user will interact with the technology.
### Techno-centric approach:
The techno-centric approach is based on the hardware and its functionality. The user must be the one to adapt to the machine and interact with it following the specifications provided by the designer.
### Antropo-centric approach:
The antropo-centric approach is based on the human and the posibilities of the user. The machine is designed to adapt to the user, and its posibilities and functions are linked to the posibilities of the user. In this approach the designer must take into account the limitations of the human body and their target populations.

## Misconceptions about HMI
- It's easy - Tools make it easy to create, but a good GUI is long and expensive
- It's an aesthetic operation of the screen - Requires an early, methodical, iterative and experimental approach
- It's only a matter of taste - There are rules to respect, which have scientific sources
- There is a miracle method
  
## The HMI must adapt to the user
An HMI system must be able to adapt to the user characteristics for an optimal user functioning.
- Physical differences
  - Age
  - disability
- Knowledge and experience
  - In the field of the task
  - In CS and/or software
- Physiological characteristics
  - Visual/auditory
  - logical/intuitive
- Socio-cultural characteristics
  - Their date format
  - color meaning
  - Direction of writing
- Context
  - The target public (general public, leisure, industry, etc...)
- Characteristics of the task
  - Sensitive to environmental changes
  - Occational, regular, daily use, etc...
  - Time constrained
  - If it is a repetitive task
- Technical constraints
  - Platform
  - Memory, bandwidth
  - Use of DRY code

## Output devices
An output device is any device generated as a response from the HMI. This is used so the user can be aware of the action performed by the HMI based on their input.
Some of the output devices are:
- Sound
- Light *Such as screens, LED, etc...*
- Haptic force
- Speech sintethyzers
  
## Input devices
An input device is any device used for generate an input from the user to the HMI to perform an action.
Some of the input devices are:
- Integrated physical terminal *such as mouse and keyboard*
- Speech
- Sound *such as a song or an external sound*
- Sensors
- Gestures

# Before VR

First stereoscope created by the english physicist Charles Wheatstone, who submitted a paper to the Royal Academy in 1838.

The stereoscope had two mirrors at 90° which reflected the gaze laterally towards the images, making us seeing them in 3D.

Pepper's ghost is an illusion technique used in the theatre, cinema, amusement parks, etc...

It is named after the English scientist Jokn Henry Pepper.

Rality-virtuality continuum (Paul Milgram, 1994)

A continuous scale that goes from the all real to the all virtual spectrum of the human interaction.

It encompasses all the possible compositions of the Human Machine Interactions.
