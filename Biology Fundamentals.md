# The Nervous system

## Neuro Physiology

Everything in neural systems is composed by electrical signals. When we talk abou the nervous system, we talk about different organs mainly covered by liquid, and the signals are provided by the pasage of water, ionas and metabolites inside and outside the cell via Simple Diffusion and Specific Membrane Proteins, so we can say that the cellular membrane is a semi-permeable membrane.

At one given moment, the cellular membrane reaches an equilibrium described by the next equation: 

$$
 E_k = \between{RT}{ZF} ...
$$

Given all of the states of the cellular membrane, we have a behavior known as membronous potential, which has:
1. Resting state
