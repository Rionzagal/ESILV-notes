# Introduction

## Evaluations
All of the quizzes will be multiple question quizzes at the end of the lecturer of the day. We will have the evaluation results the next lecture of the quiz.
- Quiz 1: October 7
- Quiz 2: November 10 `Online`
- Conference onHealth Management: November 23
- Session Presentations

## Lecture general objectives
Understand the next four 
* Health organization in France /industrialized countries and its financing, management, regulation, evaluation
* Growing interest for an improved quality of life and for research/innovation
* Population unequal access to health systems and biotechnologies for diagnostic and therapy
* The french society and the social responsabilities that _SB_ engineers can represent

# Lecture 1

## Health as a concept
What is _Health_?

This is the definition given by the **WHO**, from 1946 to  1948:
- Health is a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.
> The meaning of health has evolved odver time...

Introduction of the WHO constitution:

International Health conference.

After 2 years of deliberations/ratifications, this definition was signed by 61 countries as an **official** definition for _health_. This sets the standard aspiration to reach this state.

###  Limits and critics
Health cannot be a _state_ because it cannot be measured as a physical value of a property.
This definition is **too broad**, so everybody in the international health conference at the time would be satisfied.
This definition is considered _idealistic_, ignoring the _spiritual, environmental and cultural dimensions of the concept_.

Another definition, in 1986 at The Ottawa Charter for Health |

> The fundamental conditions and resources for health are: 
> - peace
> - shelter
> - education
> - food
> - income
> - a stable eco-system
> - sustainable resources
> - social justice and equity

This _definition_ is mainly considering the Biological, individual and social dimensions of the concept

#### Individual
- Fundamental human right 
- Central to the concept of quality of life/autonomy

#### State involvement
- Worldwide social goal
- Involves individual, state and interrnational responsibility
Its maintenance is a major social investment

## Towards Health Economy
After the end of the WWII, the French government started thinking about _health economy_ in order to start reconstructing and standing up again of the struggles of the war. 

The Health Economy in France started with 2 major key periods:
* Medical economy `Around 1950`
* Health economy `Around 1970`

#### 1950
Public authorities preoccupie by health spendings, thinking that no matter the cost, they should be covered.
+ Not to reduce them
+ But to ensure Legitimate but costly expenditure is covered
The public authoities that acted in this context were **NOT** political figures, but **doctors of the Medical Department** close to the public scene
The creation of CREDOC _(Research and Documentation Center on Consumption)_ and the DEM _(Medical economy division)_
They performed the studies on medical sendings: observation, not control.
> Comptes Nationaux de la Consommation (1ère Comptes de santé)

From **Health Economy**, the French government passed to **Medical Economy**.

#### 1960
The **Medical Economy** concept is concreted, and a Universal health insurance (Assurance maladie, 1958) is presented to cover the entirety of the french population's medical expenditures.

This system seems perfect, until the 70's, which present the problems on the lack of control over the health expenditures.

#### 1970
The economic growth is slowing down, so the government searches for different ways of how to decrease the most important spendings.
Under prime minister michel Debré and president De Gaulle Operation of French Ministry of Economy and Finance **Rationalization of budget choices** _(Rationalisation des choix budgétaires)_
Public actions made in economic terms to prioritise investment scenario according to efficiency.
Public actions were made in order to reduce the expenditures in the economic scenarios.
> Use of costs/advantages ratios
>> Investment vs Saved lives

Started the usage of Mathematical tools to allocate budgets.
The decision power is not given to the **MD**, but rather given to the **Economist engineers**, which consider more relevant the **spendings** than the **health considerations**.

Health RBC cell transfered from Miistry of Economy and Finance to the Ministry of Health.
> Health -> Health and its spendings

In a few months, studies were conducted over:
+ Flu vaccination
+ Mental health management
+ Perinatal management

Its main criticism was the a priori decisions over the studies because of the lack of medical considerations and resources to process these studies.

#### Nowadays
Several dimensions orr ministries are actually involved and cooperating Economic, legal, sociala, sociological, religious, cultural, anthropological...

1. Human sciences
    + Equity and philosophical bases forr healt/wellness/autonomy
    + Orient public politicies
2. Exact/technical sciences and medicine
    + Shape health/wellness/autonomy

# Lecture 2: The french health system

## The French health system

### Multiple structures of the French health system

In the French health system the healthcare is dealt in different structures, which vary depending on the type of care the patient needs.
- **Outpationet care**: Dealt when the patient goes by themselves to the health institution and see a _General Practitioner_. It is the _First Line_ of the health system.
- **Hospital care**: This dealt when the patient goes to the health institution for an extended treatment. It is given when the patient has a life treatening condition, either urgent or planned.
- **Social/medico-social care**: This type of care is mainly dealt to elderly populations and populations in precarious situations or situations of handicap.

### A principle

In essence, the patients are **free to choose** their health services in the _public_ or _private_ sectors.
- Doctor
- Health institution
- Accomodation structure

### A societal contract

**Reimbursable benefits nomenclature**
- Outpatient care _(General Practitioners/Specialists, dentists, midwives, ...)_
- Hospital care in rehabilitation establishments (**Public or Private**)
- MD-prescribed diagnostic exams and care
  > labs/paramedical professionals, physiotherapist, speech therapist, ...
- MD-prescribed medication, medical devices, prosthesis, ...
  > There are exceptions to these benefits, and not all of them are covered.

## Organization and management

### The Ministries

They are organizations that act as the _Direct intervention of the State_ for Organizing and funding health and medico-social supply.

The ministries are in chare of:
- _Solidarités et de la santé_
- _Action et comptes publics_ (budget, public accounts, public functions)

The ministries have missions such as:
- **Management and implementation** of public health, health surveillance, health safety policies
- **Supervision** of health/rehabilitation institutions and **training** of the healthcare professionals
- **Financing** health/medico-social institutions
  > Setting medical acts' _rates_ and healthcare _expenditure control_.

The ministries are divided in different types of institutions:
- State agencies or institutions
- Health system users and patients associations

#### State agencies or institutions
##### Regional Health Agency (Agence Régional de la Santé)

This agency has the same mission at different degrees of details and levels. It was created in _2010_ to regroup administrations and improve public actions for health matters.

Its mission is the **Coherent management of resources** towards equal health access in regions.

##### Agence de la biomédicine

This is a public and national state agency, and it is the **authority for medical, scientific and ethical** matters and rules concerning:
* Cellular and biological tissues
* Transplants
* Procreation
* Embryology
* Human genetics

This agency provides authorisation for _stem cell research_, as well as it holds the national database for _bone marrow donors_.

##### Étabissement Français du Sang

This is the civil entity for blood transfusion in France. Their goal is to achieve the national self-sufficiency in blood products. 

This entity is in charge of:
- **Analyses** for blood transfusion and organ transplants, immunology and donor-recipient pairing. 
- Research (_in terms of tissue engineering, cell therapy, immunology and donor-recipient pairing_)

#### Health system users and patients associations

They are associations composed mainly of patients and users of the health system, and are considered as **qualified** to participate in the **surveillance actions** of health institutions. 

They are the **principal withesses** of healthcare _quality and improvement_. As users, they are in **_Permanent control_** of healthcare insititutions' management.

## Funding

### French Medical Insurance

The funding of the health insurance has three schemes (régime). Contributions to a fund known as _Union national des caisses d'assurance maladie (UNCAM)_.
- Workers scheme:
  - This scheme starts as soon as you start working for any company in France.
- Self-employed scheme:
  - This scheme starts when you work by your self, without being affiliated to a company.
- Agricultural scheme:
  - You are attached to this scheme when you work into the agricultural field of work.

> **Game rules:**
> These rules apply to all of the scemes mentioned before.
> 1. It is a **mandatory membership**. When you start working in any of the three fields (normal work, self-employment, agricultural), you have to contribute directly to the scheme that suits your case. 
> 2. **Contribution** to this fund _based on the income_. The more you earn, the more you contribute.
> 3. **Solidarity**: healthcare according to needs. This system functions according to your needs, and you use it as you need it.

#### Union Nationale des Caisses d'Assurance Maladie _(UNCAM)_
Focuses on the **major health risks** for the insured person income. _Based on the income_ of the asured person.

Establishes: 
- The policy setting the **connection** between health insurance and health professionals
- The reimbursable benefits nomenclature: which medical acts are reimbursed
- The [care coverage rate](#).

> Factors that can affect the insured person income, which also affect their insurance:
> - Long-term care
> - Costly care

### Insurance companies and mutual funds:

They are not mandatory insurance programs, which are destined to complement the UNCAM membership. The user can decide wether to subscribe to an insurance plan on any of these companies on any scheme or not.

> Game rules:
> 1. **Solidarity**: The user also contributes to the health insurance fund, but for a lesser group. (only for those who joined the insurance plan)
> 2. Healthcare based according to the **subscription** of the user ._(The more you pay, the more things the insurance plan will cover)_
> 3. **Coverage**: They mainly cover what the French health insurance does not already cover. They propose to cover everything **outside** the _reimbursable benefits nomenclature_.

### Public finances (The State)

Not finance healthcare per say, but its general frame. This way, the state contributes to the healthcare of its people without directly involving on the full payment of the medical costs of the patients.

> Examples:
> - Prevention and awareness campaigns _(AIDS, COVID, flu, etc...)_
> - Medical and pharmaceutical research _(Agence nationale de la recherche, financement de l'innovation et de la R&D)_
> - _Direct_ Health professional training in free universities, such as doctors, dentists, pharmacists, etc.. _(Excluding Biomedical engineers and any other professional indirectly involved in healthcare)_

### Households

The costs are covered, in part, by the health system users. Meaning that the UNCAM and the private insurance companies do not fully reimburse the medical costs of healthcare.

A few numbers...
> In France in 2020:
>> 6.5% of the households consumption vs. 209.2 billion euros for _healthcare_.

## Delivery of care

### Outpationt care (non-hospital-based care)

Can take two forms: **Primary** and **preventive** care.

- Primary care:
  - The type of care when the patient can go and see a health professional by themselves, and there is no imminent danger to their life.
- Preventive care:
  - The type of care in which the patient goes for the prevention of sickness.

Involving health professionals:
- Medical or pharmaceutical professionals. doctors, pharmacists, dentists, etc...
- Medical assistants ( nueses, physiotherapists, language therapists, etc...)

### Hospital care

It is provided by either **Public institutions**, **Private _(wether for-profit or non-profit)_ institutions**, which provide either general or specific healthcare treatment for the patient when needed.

Each insitution must be able to provide the next services, depending on the needs of the patient:
- Diagnostic, treatment, follow-up for the ill, wounded and pregnancy
- General care (general practice, surgery, ObGym)
- Specialized care (psychiatry, mental health, etc...)

### Groupments hospitaliers de territoires _(GHT)_

It is destined to enhance healthcare provision through the agrupation of public institutions present in the same zone and sharing their resources between each other. Provides the access to medical equipment, biomedical technologies and other resources when an institution has a certain situation but does not have the resources or equipment to solve it. The goal of this initiative is the **equal access to healthcare**. 

> Mandatory since 2016 between public institutions in a given territory: management issues, on smaller territories than those ARS consider.

### Long-term care

Medico-social institutions managing healthcare but other aspects for needed populations, which have different conditions than the rest of the population:
- Elderly
- Disabled population
- popilation in precarious conditions
  - Handicap
  - Violence
  - Poverty _(youth)_
  - etc...

They provide _educative (or medico-educative)_, _medical and therapeutical_, _pedagogic and training_ actions to the target populations in order to provide the needed healthcare type for them.

### Pharmacy

Provides drugs and medication that were prescribed or are needed to restore the health of the patient when needed.

> See part 5: State intervention and regulation...
> [ANSM (Agence nationale de sécurité du médicament)](#)

## State intervention and regulation

### Regional Health Agences

They are in charge of inspecting and controlling the healthcare provision, following national policies. They are able to proceed their function by two ways:
- How health and medico-social institutions are run
- Medical acts and handle of medical practices

#### Inspection and control missions

The Regional health agences are in charge of...

**How health institutions are ran**
- How and where care is provided -> measures in different services.

**How medico-social institutions are ran**
- Identify and prevent abuse.

**For both**
- Review the qualifications and number of the permanent staff
- Review the on-call staff (qualifications and number)

**Medical acts and professional practices**
- Actions taken with the French health insurance  and medical associations. Everything that is prescribed actually has a plausible reason.
- Prescription for medical acts. (No medical acts happen without prescription)
- Medical act justification. (The medical act has a valid justification according to the prescription)
- Awareness programs on medical actons
  - _Security, quality, compliance_

### ANSM

French national authority. Their job is to ensure that everything on the market follows the proper procedures before it is approved.
- Drugs/medication
- Biological products
- Medical deevices
- Cosmetics and tattoos

#### ANSES

French national authority concering food and beverage.


### HAS (High Health Authority)
An independant partner to the ANSM. Their goals are to **accredit doctors and health teams** to practice in health institutions and **deliver a certification** to every public and private health institution. 
It is in charge to **evaluate** the _healthcare quality_ and improvement and _good clinical practices_ provided by the healthcare institutions.

# Lecture 3: Health Supply and Demand: Market and Particularities

## Health demand and healthcare demand

### Health, a specific product

Let's start with an example...

**A bakery shop...**

- In terms of **choice**: you can choose whatever product you want within their inventory.
- In terms of **funding**: when you buy your product, you pay it with your money.
- In terms of **quality**: you decide if you liked the price of the product and the price, and you can evaluate the institution by a relation between both.

**In healthcare...**

- In terms of **choice**: you either have a Generalist or Specialist practitioners as choices.
- In terms of **funding**: it comes from different sources _(health insurance)_.
- In terms of **quality**: it depends of the Expenditure efficiency _(medical acts, waiting lists, ...)_, after-effects of the treatments, equity, ...

In the healthcare point of view the **patient** is defined as the _consumer_, and the **Health needs** are defined as the _product_

### Health needs

Can be defined as the difference between the **Desired** state of health and the **Existing** state of health, which, depending on the specific need, can be _measured_ by a doctor.

They are divided into two categories:

1. Primary needs: Needs that are **essential to life** on a biological and physical level. **They are absolute**
2. Secondary needs: Needs that are varying according to individuals or social groups, such as _mental_ and _social_ well-being. **They are relative to the patient**

At an individual level, that different results from the **unpredictable degradation of health** are due to:
- Epidemiologic risk: The probability you'd get sick _(virus, cancer, ...)_.
- Normal aging process

In order to define and quantify the health states to evaluate the health needs, two parameters must be set.

- **Desired** state of health
  - Absolute: The ideal state of health according to the experts.
  - Relative: Use territorial comparisons to set a standard.

In the end, both ways take out the factor of the **patient individuality** from the equation, which disconnects them from the goal.

- **Existing** state of health
  - Morbidity: (insufficient data, not systematically recorded)
  - Mortality: (partial truth)

### From health needs to healthcare demands

**Health demand** is concieved as the expression of the health needs to the health professionals. In order to pass from a health need to a health demand, a patient must know the **Desired** state of health and the **Existing** state of health.

**Health care demand**
- Economic theoretical concept, meaning in health economy
- Developped from 1960 to 2000

Beacon dates and researchers/health economists:
- **US:**
  - Henneth Arrow _(1963)_: Uncertainty and the Welfare Economics of Medical Care, American Economic Review.
  > _"**Illnes** is, thus, not only **risky** but a **costly risk** in itself, apart from the **cost of medical care**."_
  > Illness will not only be the biological risk to the patient, but it will also be a monetary risk for them, as well as an impact of their medical care.
  - Michael Grossman _(1972)_: On the concept of health capital and the demand for health Journal of Political Economy.
    - 1st model of the _Health Demand_ concept
    - Relation between **health demand** and **healthcare demand**, saying that the 2nd is derived from the 1st.
  
- **France:**
  - Lise Rochaix _(1997)_: _Individual_ vs _economical_ aspect and the whole chain involved.
    - When you express a **health need** to a practitioner, it becomes a **health demand**, and in order to take care of it, there is also an **economical need** to satisfy this individual need that impacts the _health system_ as a whole.

## Health supply: uncertainty and risk
### Definition

The deliverance of health to meet health demands, or expressed health needs using medical goods and services _(protheses, drugs and medication, consults, exams, ...)_.

> In an ideal situaltion in the health system, the **Health supply** equals the **Health demand**.

### Market uncertainty and risk

In practice, the practitioners' health actions are considered as a **black box** due to their _autonomy_, meaning that there is no way for the patient to measure the way in which the practitioner is delivering the health. _(Which form does the supply actually take?)_

## Health supply: Concurrency, monopole and regulation
### Concurrency

In France, there has been a brutal increase in practitioners numbers between 1970 and 1990. This increase in the amount of practitioners cannot be explained by the health demand of health in the country.

### Concurrency: induced demand

Theory:
Practitioners provide more than the demands expressed by the patient and are able to influence them by advising: 
- More technical acts
- More consults

> Introduced in 1973 by _R. G. Evans, (American health economist)_.

This will virtually inflate the number of consults and thus the cost of the medical practice without a real necessity to abide for it. So the quality of the medical practice **deteriorates** due to these unnecessary, _induced_ health demand.

There are two factors that cause this effect...
- The behaviour particularly observable for practitioners paid per medical act (_médecins libéraux en France_).
- Practitioners want to ensure their _goal income_, in a context of **high concurrency**.

### Private health insurance

This is an actor in the health supply.
Dysfunction:
- An individual in a _poor health state_ tends to purchase an insurance **more frequently** than an individual with a _regular_ or _high health state_.
  > This is allowed, but it unbalances the health market because is virtually increasing the demand numbers.

- Actuarially-fixed premium (prime d'assurance)
  - Premium cost based on general statistics of risk mortality based on morbidity general statistics / patient health history
  - Selecting covered risks in order to avoid reinbursing risks of high mortallity.

### Monopole and regulation

> Remider: the health system goal is the redistribution of wealth i favor of low incomes (_who also are the sickest_)

In order to help achieve the goal, there is:
- State intervention
- Regulation in health private insurances and their coverage.
- Public monopole: Even thoug the health system is not reinbursing everything, the public health system is the one that dominates the health market.

# Lecture 4 Analyze and evaluate health policies

## Fundamental principles of economics evaluation

### Methods and tools

Goal: Improvement of the health system quality with the strong constraints of spendings (public spendings or other).

[HAUTE AUTORITÉ DE SANTÉ](#has-high-health-authority) Is the organism that controls and supervises the quality of the health system. 

HAS: created by a law, relatively to the health system (2004)

Its goals are to **reinforce healthcare quality** for patients benefits and mantain a **united and equitable** health system. 

HAS has two mandates, which define their mission and objective:
- Continuous improvement of health professionals' practices.
- Help provided to public decision takers (**optimizing management** of reimbursable goods/service)

HAS is independant from the healthcare ministries.

New mission of economics **evaluation**, based on the _Law for financing the public health system (2008)_.

> As part of its missions, HAS issues recommendations and medico-economic opinions on the most efficient care, prescription or treatment strategies.

HAS original methodological guide was published in 2011, and last update in July 2020 in the _Guide Methodologique, choix méthodologiques pour l'évaluation économique à la HAS_. It contains the followed methods used by the HAS in order to issue their recommendations in terms of healthcare quality evaluation.

For medico-economic recommendations:
- Health economics evaluation
  - cost-utility analysis (quality-adjusted life-years)
  - cost-effectiveness analysis
- Costs evaluation
### Cost-utility analysis (_CUA_)

They are used for compare two strategies/programs/initiatives based on their:
- Costs: How much is spent on the procedure/initiative
- Results: The life-year earned and quality of life _(Quality-Adjusted Life-Years => QALY)_
  > But how do we calculate the QALY to get the results?

The evaluation criteria can be described as:
$$
  X = cost/QALY
$$

The QALY is then a result **indicator** (as a health economy term)

It is evaluated as: Life-Year Quality Factor.
> It is evaluates from 0 to 1, in which 0 means _death_, and 1 means _the best life quality possible_.

The Quality of life is evaluated through questionaries, using questions about the patient's life quality. They are standarized and applied by the healthcare institution before and after the procedure in order to compare the results. 
> Other versions of these questionnaires are available, either to evaluate children, morbid population, and other special cases.

Some examples (recomended by the HAS):
- Euroqol EQ-5D/SF-6D
- HUI3

What does the _D_ means in Euroqol?
> It stands for _Dimension_, meaning the aspect in the patient's form of life

Some Dimensions:
- Mobility
- autonomy
- daily living
- pain
- anxiety
> Hundreds of possible health states are described through these questionaires.

#### Textbook example

![An image](#)

This is a visual representation of comparing 2 medical initiatives.

Use and impact of the QALY:
- Death occurence
- Health state

### Cost-effectiveness analysis

The comparison of two alternative health programs/strategies based on their **costs** and their **effectiveness**.

An effective strategy allows to achieve results corresponding to objectives set a priory (not a constraint of time).

> _For example:_ A new drug, new medical device, new health management program vs a previous one. <br>
> In this case _"doing nothing"_ is also an option.

In order to use this method, the 2 programs/strategies:
- are used for the same indication
- can be evaluated by a common effectiveness criterion
  - > HAS recommends _"Life-year gained"_

The result is described byan incremental cost-effectivenes ratio (ICER):

$$
  ICER = \delta cost / \delta effectiveness
$$

for both strategies 
### Cost evaluation

The **Cost evaluation** is a Comparative analysis between 2 or more program/strategies, and is used to associate a **monetary value to goods and services** consumed to set up a health program/strategy.

The **Cost evaluation** sees as _goods and services_:
- Hospital and outpatient care
- Healthcare to the elderly and handicaped population
- Medical goods (drugs, medical devices, etc...)
- Medical transportation
- Organization of health programs
- Time spent: Beneficiaries and medical professionals

### Interpretation for decision support and limits

- Cost-utility analysis result: costs/QALY ratio. 

Meaning: additional costs for earned QALY

Unknown: willingness to pay... At some point, we have to evaluate the willingness to pay of the government in order to see if they will actually agree to use the _"best"_ method in a given country. For this, there is a need for projections in order to evaluate this parameter and what is the maximum acceptable cost for a given time of _perfect health_.

- Cost-Effectiveness analysis:
This is a direct interpretation of the **clienical and economical** interest of a new strategy _(cost of a gained lif-year)_.

A single effectiveness criterion evaluated at a time/analysis. 
No evaluation of the strategy's **impact on quality of life**. 

> in general CUA and CEA must be used as a combination, not any one by itself.

- Cost evaluation:
This is a simple, comparative analysis between past and future programs/medical initiatives. It uses the cost estimation of every included goods or services.

Considerations to take into account:
- Costs actualization: reducing a future cost to its present value
- Costs adjustment for inflation. 

## International comparisons: The USA

### Foreword

No state policies for individual social protection before 1933 in the USA.

The private actors have central roles in the medical system.

This is an accidental system, which means that it is not thought beforehand.

### Social Security Act

- 1st approved law on social security in Agust 14, 1935.
- Social protection including:
  - Retirement
  - unemployment
  - Benefits for the disables
  - Support for widows and orphans
- There is no health invalidity conscerns for the next 30 years.

### Health system organization

In Europe there is 2 models:

- **Beveridge** model: Coverage of the health system expenditure is completely financed by the tax payment (originated in England).
- **Bismark** model: Coverage of the health system expenditure is financed based on social cotisation (used in France, Germany, Belgium, Luxemburg, Austria).

In USA, the public authority (state, federal state) interevenes/chooses which populations to support in terms of health coverage.
> The State excludes populations with too high/low incomes or that are too young to be eligible to health programs. 
### Medicaid and Medicare

- **Medicare**:
Is a program managed by the **Federal government**. It covers citizens older than 65 years of age and/or disabled
- **Medicaid**:
This is a social welfare, managed by the specific states _(50 different programs)_ and covers the **poor** population.
> Economic criteria: low incoms, elderly, disabled, children

>For a single person , different health managements apply from one state to the other.

#### Funding sources

Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Funds, 1965.

- Medicare funding: Collected by the Federal state in the form of _taxes_. It is paid _Premium_ by the insured user.
- Medicaid funding: Is funded 57% by the Federal state, and completed by the specific state.

### State of the healthcare system: indicators

Health expenditure, % Gross domestic product (PIB)
![Table 1](#)

Health expenses per inhabitant:
  - Health care
  - Health system administrative costs

#### State of the healthcare system: WHO performacnces

# Lecture 5: Regulation of Health Expenditure

## Health accounts equilibrium

### Helth accounts equilibrium ~ 1950

Public authorities preoccupied by health spendings:
- Not to reduce them
- Insure legitimate expenditures to cover the needs of the population

### 1960 - 1970

- 1960: 
  - Creation of a Medical Economy
  - Creation of a Universal health insurance (Assurance maladie)
- 1970:
  - Rationalisation of budgetary choices

### 1974 - Social protection generalisation

Creation of Social protection generalisation, presented in September 1974

- Coverage to the population that was not covered by the _Assurance Maladie_
- Presented by Michel Durafour, **Minister of work and social security**
- Finally adopted on December 24, 1974
  - Evey part of the nation should be covered by this health proposition.
  - Every form of expenditure should be recorded and declared

### Evolution of health expenditure in France

Expenditure tabs kept in check using **Costs evaluation** method in order to know the monetary value spent in all healthcare aspects of the medical system.

Evaluation included: **Consommation des soins et biens médicaux _(CSBM)_**
- Hospital and outpatient care
- Healthcare to the elderly and handicaped population
- Medical goods
- Medical transportation
- Organization of health programs
- Time spent: _by beneficiaries and medical professionals_

#### Consommation des soins et biens médicaux _(CSBM)_

Institution preocupied for the evolution of the health expenditure in France and healthcare methods and processes.

It tracks the costs evaluation of the French healthcare culture and compares them against past years.

## Financing CSBM

### 3 actors

- Health system (_Sécurité sociale / Workers contributions_): 79.8% in 2021
- Organizmes complémentaires: 12.9% in 2021
  - Mutual funds
  - Private health insurances
- State: 0.4% in 2021
- Reste à charge (RAC) des ménages
  - RAC = CSBM - HS - OC - S

## How to get back to equilibrium?

### Lois du financement de la Sécurité Sociale (LFSS)

Initiative preformed in 1996. It is here to set the general conditions of what the health system is planning to spend and contribute. 

It is voted each year by the parliament.

Goal: To reach the national objective of social seciurity expenses

### Revenue lever

- Taxation (fiscalisation)
  - increase social cotisation
  - taxes (e.g. on indemnités journalières - daily allowance - for sick leave or accident at work)
- Increase use participation
  - Forfait hospitalier (hospital package): the biggest part of the cost still covered by the health system, but a portion the rest by the user
