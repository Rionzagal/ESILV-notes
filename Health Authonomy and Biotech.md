## Organization and management

## Funding

### French Medical Insurance

The funding of the health insurance has three schemes (régime). Contributions to a fund known as _Union national des caisses d'addurance maladie (UNCAM)_.
- Workers scheme:
  - This scheme starts as soon as you start working for any company in France.
- Self-employed scheme:
  - This scheme starts when you work by your self, without being affiliated to a company.
- Agricultural scheme:
  - You are attached to this scheme when you work into the agricultural field of work.

> **Game rules:**
> These rules apply to all of the scemes mentioned before.
> 1. It is a mandatory membership. When you start working in any of the three fields (normal work, self-employment, agricultural), you have to contribute directly to the scheme that suits your case. 
> 2. Contribution to this fund based on the income. The more you earn, the more you contribute.
> 3. Solidarity: healthcare according to needs. This system functions according to your needs, and you use it as you need it.

Union nationale des caisses d'assurance maladie
Focuses on the major health risks for the insured person income. Based on the income of the asured person.

Establishes: 
- The policy setting the **connection** between health insurance and health professionals
- The reimbursable benefits nomenclature: which medical acts are reimbursed
- The [care coverage rate](#).

> Factors that can affect the insured person income, which also affect their insurance:
> - Long-term care
> - Costly care

### Insurance companies and mutual funds:

They are not mandatory insurance programs, which are destined to complement the UNCAM membership. The user can decide wether to subscribe to an insurance plan on any of these companies on any scheme or not.

> Game rules:
> 1. **Solidarity**: The user also contributes to the health insurance fund, but for a lesser group. (only for those who joined the insurance plan)
> 2. Healthcare based according to the **subscription** of the user ._(The more you pay, the more things the insurance plan will cover)_
> 3. **Coverage**: They mainly cover what the French health insurance does not already cover. They propose to cover everything **outside** the _reimbursable benefits nomenclature_.

### Public finances (The State)

Not finance healthcare per say, but its general frame. This way, the state contributes to the healthcare of its people without directly involving on the full payment of the medical costs of the patients.

> Examples:
> - Prevention and awareness campaigns _(AIDS, COVID, flu, etc...)_
> - Medical and pharmaceutical research _(Agence nationale de la recherche, financement de l'innovation et de la R&D)_
> - _Direct_ Health professional training in free universities, such as doctors, dentists, pharmacists, etc.. _(Excluding Biomedical engineers and any other professional indirectly involved in healthcare)_

### Households

The costs are covered, in part, by the health system users. Meaning that the UNCAM and the private insurance companies do not fully reimburse the medical costs of healthcare.

A few numbers...
> In France in 2020:
>> 6.5% of the households consumption vs. 209.2 billion euros for _healthcare_.

## Delivery of care

### Outpationt care (non-hospital-based care)

Can take two forms: **Primary** and **preventive** care.

- Primary care:
  - The type of care when the patient can go and see a health professional by themselves, and there is no imminent danger to their life.
- Preventive care:
  - The type of care in which the patient goes for the prevention of sickness.

Involving health professionals:
- Medical or pharmaceutical professionals. doctors, pharmacists, dentists, etc...
- Medical assistants ( nueses, physiotherapists, language therapists, etc...)

### Hospital care

It is provided by either **Public institutions**, **Private _(wether for-profit or non-profit)_ institutions**, which provide either general or specific healthcare treatment for the patient when needed.

Each insitution must be able to provide the next services, depending on the needs of the patient:
- Diagnostic, treatment, follow-up for the ill, wounded and pregnancy
- General care (general practice, surgery, ObGym)
- Specialized care (psychiatry, mental health, etc...)

### Groupments hospitaliers de territoires _(GHT)_

It is destined to enhance healthcare provision through the agrupation of public institutions present in the same zone and sharing their resources between each other. Provides the access to medical equipment, biomedical technologies and other resources when an institution has a certain situation but does not have the resources or equipment to solve it. The goal of this initiative is the **equal access to healthcare**. 

> Mandatory since 2016 between public institutions in a given territory: management issues, on smaller territories than those ARS consider.

### Long-term care

Medico-social institutions managing healthcare but other aspects for needed populations, which have different conditions than the rest of the population:
- Elderly
- Disabled population
- popilation in precarious conditions
  - Handicap
  - Violence
  - Poverty _(youth)_
  - etc...

They provide _educative (or medico-educative)_, _medical and therapeutical_, _pedagogic and training_ actions to the target populations in order to provide the needed healthcare type for them.

### Pharmacy

Provides drugs and medication that were prescribed or are needed to restore the health of the patient when needed.

> See part 5: State intervention and regulation...
> [ANSM (Agence nationale de sécurité du médicament)](#)

## State intervention and regulation

### Regional Health Agences

They are in charge of inspecting and controlling the healthcare provision, following national policies. They are able to proceed their function by two ways:
- How health and medico-social institutions are run
- Medical acts and handle of medical practices

#### Inspection and control missions

The Regional health agences are in charge of...

**How health institutions are ran**
- How and where care is provided -> measures in different services.

**How medico-social institutions are ran**
- Identify and prevent abuse.

**For both**
- Review the qualifications and number of the permanent staff
- Review the on-call staff (qualifications and number)

**Medical acts and professional practices**
- Actions taken with the French health insurance  and medical associations. Everything that is prescribed actually has a plausible reason.
- Prescription for medical acts. (No medical acts happen without prescription)
- Medical act justification. (The medical act has a valid justification according to the prescription)
- Awareness programs on medical actons
  - _Security, quality, compliance_

### ANSM

French national authority. Their job is to ensure that everything on the market follows the proper procedures before it is approved.
- Drugs/medication
- Biological products
- Medical deevices
- Cosmetics and tattoos

#### ANSES

French national authority concering food and beverage.


### HAS (High Health Authority)
An independant partner to the ANSM. Their goals are to **accredit doctors and health teams** to practice in health institutions and **deliver a certification** to every public and private health institution. 
It is in charge to **evaluate** the _healthcare quality_ and improvement and _good clinical practices_ provided by the healthcare institutions.

# Lecture 3: Health Supply and Demand: Market and Particularities

## Health demand and healthcare demand

### Health, a specific product

Let's start with an example...

**A bakery shop...**

- In terms of **choice**: you can choose whatever product you want within their inventory.
- In terms of **funding**: when you buy your product, you pay it with your money.
- In terms of **quality**: you decide if you liked the price of the product and the price, and you can evaluate the institution by a relation between both.

**In healthcare...**

- In terms of **choice**: you either have a Generalist or Specialist practitioners as choices.
- In terms of **funding**: it comes from different sources _(health insurance)_.
- In terms of **quality**: it depends of the Expenditure efficiency _(medical acts, waiting lists, ...)_, after-effects of the treatments, equity, ...

In the healthcare point of view the **patient** is defined as the _consumer_, and the **Health needs** are defined as the _product_

### Health needs

Can be defined as the difference between the **Desired** state of health and the **Existing** state of health, which, depending on the specific need, can be _measured_ by a doctor.

They are divided into two categories:

1. Primary needs: Needs that are **essential to life** on a biological and physical level. **They are absolute**
2. Secondary needs: Needs that are varying according to individuals or social groups, such as _mental_ and _social_ well-being. **They are relative to the patient**

At an individual level, that different results from the **unpredictable degradation of health** are due to:
- Epidemiologic risk: The probability you'd get sick _(virus, cancer, ...)_.
- Normal aging process

In order to define and quantify the health states to evaluate the health needs, two parameters must be set.

- **Desired** state of health
  - Absolute: The ideal state of health according to the experts.
  - Relative: Use territorial comparisons to set a standard.

In the end, both ways take out the factor of the **patient individuality** from the equation, which disconnects them from the goal.

- **Existing** state of health
  - Morbidity: (insufficient data, not systematically recorded)
  - Mortality: (partial truth)

### From health needs to healthcare demands

**Health demand** is concieved as the expression of the health needs to the health professionals. In order to pass from a health need to a health demand, a patient must know the **Desired** state of health and the **Existing** state of health.

**Health care demand**
- Economic theoretical concept, meaning in health economy
- Developped from 1960 to 2000

Beacon dates and researchers/health economists:
- **US:**
  - Henneth Arrow _(1963)_: Uncertainty and the Welfare Economics of Medical Care, American Economic Review.
  > _"**Illnes** is, thus, not only **risky** but a **costly risk** in itself, apart from the **cost of medical care**."_
  > Illness will not only be the biological risk to the patient, but it will also be a monetary risk for them, as well as an impact of their medical care.
  - Michael Grossman _(1972)_: On the concept of health capital and the demand for health Journal of Political Economy.
    - 1st model of the _Health Demand_ concept
    - Relation between **health demand** and **healthcare demand**, saying that the 2nd is derived from the 1st.
  
- **France:**
  - Lise Rochaix _(1997)_: _Individual_ vs _economical_ aspect and the whole chain involved.
    - When you express a **health need** to a practitioner, it becomes a **health demand**, and in order to take care of it, there is also an **economical need** to satisfy this individual need that impacts the _health system_ as a whole.
