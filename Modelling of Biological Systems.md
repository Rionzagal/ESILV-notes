## Introduction to modeling
A **Model** is a description of a _system_. 
A **System** is any collection of interrelated _objects_.
An **Object** is some elemental unit upon which observations can be made, but whose internal structure either does not exist or is ignored.

There are different types of models.
  - Conceptual
  - Physical
  - Formal
  - Diagrammatic

There are **Fixed** or **Dynamic** models.
  - Fixed: Elements of a system are correlated by some way statically.
  - Dynamic: Depend of time. 

### Dynamic systems
Dynamic systems are systems where one or several variables change through time according to certain rules.

#### Predictive models
Models that can be used to make concrete, quantitative predictions about the future.

#### Proof of concept models
They are for general understanding.
Proof that some hypotheses explain a given behavior (theoretical or not).

### Discrete models
Models in which time proceeds in a step-wise manner. Time in this model always has positive, stepped numbers.

### Continuous models
Models in which time proceeds through a real number.

### Deterministic models
Once all parameters and initial conditions are set, the variables change in a mechanincal, _predestined_ manner.
> Multiple iterations of the same model produce the same outcome

### Stochastic models
Some variables have a randomized behavior.
> Multiple iterations of the same model produce randomized values based on an _average_ behavior.

## Advices for presentations

### Make the presentation understandable to everyone

- Put an intro / context
- Clearly explain the problem to be solved
- Do not use specific vocabulary (or define acronimes before, etc...)
- Conclude by summarizing the essential points
- Open up (perspectives) by explaining what coud be done to improve the study/to go further

### Do not be boring for the audience

- Pay attention to the aesthetics of the slides _(backgroud, font, etc...)_
- Use visual elements _(graphs, illustrations, etc...)_ **BUT EXPLAIN THEM!**
- Make logical transitions between the slides _(connect them to the oral presentation)_
- A **little bit of humor** can make the presentation more dynamic

### Do not distract the audience

- Not too much information per slide. _Otherwise the audience reads and does not listen anymore_
- Not too many illustrations or humor. (It does not look serious)
- Be consistent! (font size, alignment of elements, etc...)

### The presenter (YOU)

- Do not read sheets of paper. _It looks poorly prepared and disconnect you from the audience._
- Do not read the slides. _But use them to maje your speech._
- Do not be **fidgety**, but not too **rigid** either.
- Speak **articulately** and **slowly**. _Silence can be used to place the presentation._
- Look frequently at your audience. _Eye contact is useful._
- If you feel stressed, use the _"I am in control, I will adapt"_ manner of pedagogic approach.
- Do not **endure** your presentation

> For the next time:
> - Learn and try to remember every part of the structure of a scientific article.
> - Bring a list of diseases that you are interested in.

> Exams:
> - An **Oral** part in class. Individual, for 5 minutes. An article of your choice and its content in the cleares way.
>   - Send by e-mail the title of the chose article.
> - A **Written** part to be sent in _PDF_ by e-mail. Where oyu will have to write in group an article (max. 5 persons/group). Synthesis on research concerning a single disease of your choice and the associated studi biological models.
