## Exercise: analysis of a significant experience (part 1)

Creating a medical device for patients with anxious disorders.

- I formed part of a team with the goal of creating a medical device destined to monitor the physiological signals of patients with anxious disorders and to record them when they were having what is known as a _panic attack_. This device resulted to be a vest with different sensors and circuits to monitor the Heart rate, Respitatory rate and EDA _(electro-dermic response)_ at all times, and record the time when the patient experienced a panic attack. This vest also contained a micro-controller unit connected to all of the circuits and reading all of their responses, then passing the results to a mobile app for Android devices.
- I was mainly in charge to program the micro-controller to read and record the responses of each and every circuit implanted into the device, as well as to program the mobile application
