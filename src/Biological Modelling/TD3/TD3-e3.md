# Exercice III (facultative in the report)
The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a powerful and very widely used molecular
method to amplify DNA fragments.
Here is how it basically works, to amplify a DNA fragment you need:
- The double helix DNA strands to replicate, your “template” DNA, from which you are going to target a specific sequence, usually between 0,1 and 10 kilo base pair (kbp) long.
- An enzyme, the DNA polymerase (hence the name)
- Primers. A primer is a short single strand of DNA, able to bind to DNA strand 
- Nucleotides
- A buffer solution, to create a viable environment
- Bivalent cations, like magnesium ions

A cycle of PCR takes 3 successive phases:
1. Denaturation: the solution is heated to above 90°C, in order to break the
hydrogen bonds between the two strands of DNA
2. Annealing: at a lower temperature, primers are going to bind to the DNA
strands. Primers match specific sequences of DNA and are used to start the
process. You need one primer per DNA strand
3. Extension: the polymerase uses the available nucleotides to create
complementary DNA strand for each of the original strands. This create more
strands of identical DNA. 

This cycle is then repeated several times, usually about 40, to create a large number of
copies.

For this exercise, it is asked to develop a model that predicts the number of DNA
fragments after each round of amplification, for each of these situations :

A. Assume that there is always an excess of primers and nucleotides present in the
solution, and that all DNA fragments are copied in each round of replication.
Modeling Bi

B. Assume that there is always an excess of primers and nucleotides present in the
solution, but that now a certain fraction of DNA fragments fails to replicate in each
round.

C. Assume that all DNA fragments can be replicated in principle but that now primers
are no longer present in excess. (There might be enough primers for the first few
rounds but not for later rounds.) Nucleotides are still always present in excess.

D. Finally, assume that all DNA fragments can be replicated in principle and that
primers are always present in excess, but that the number of free nucleotides in the
solution can become limiting. To keep the model simple, just assume that a certain
fixed number of nucleotides is required to replicate one DNA molecule, but do not
distinguish between different types of nucleotides. Note that this model version is
more challenging than the others in that it will probably require more than one
variable!
