# What is Clustering?
Clustering refers to the process of generating labeled groups of data based on how **similar** they are.
_Clustering_ is **similar** to _Classification_, but not quite the same...

## Characteristics

- Clustering is a method of **UNSUPERVISED LEARNING**
  - So, it has no _target_ or _ground truth_ to estimate.
- Does not have a specific label order
- Can group the data through different methods:
  - K-means
  - K-nearest neighbors
  - Hierarchical clustering
